# MaternalCare-ML
**Role as ML Cohort:** We focus on applying deep learning models and techniques to predict maternal health risks based on existing medical data. The output is an analysis of pregnancy risk for mothers and potential challenges they may face. This can be useful for preventing stunting in fetuses and minimizing the risk of miscarriage.
